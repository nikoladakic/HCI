        <h2>About aplication</h2>
        <p>This page contains a brief description of the application to make it easier for users to use.</p>
        <p>Application enables us to quickly and easily review stock exchanges and their main values. </br>In addition to stock exchanges, we also have a crypto currency review.
           With this application, the users who are dealing with the stock exchange can quickly and easily check the stock status.</br> Data can be tracked on graphs and tables, 
           where there is the possibility of tracking multiple stocks, thus comparing their values.	
        </p>

        <h4>Stocks parameters</h4>
        <p>First of all, we note that each share on the stock exchange has its own label,</br> which is a shortened name such as the MCD for McDonald's Corporation.</p>
        <p>In addition to the time parameter, stocks have more parameters </br>that we will briefly explain for easier understanding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open: The price at the beginning of the trading day,</li>
          <li>High: The highest price the stock reached during the day,</li>
          <li>Low: The lowest price reached during the day,</li>
          <li>Close: The final price.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h4>Images</h4>
        <p>The figure below shows that we have a choice of stock options on the stock exchange, </br>Dashboard with multiple stock options and </br>
        	Custom View with a graphs of several stock exchanges.</p>

        <p>
          Of course, since we have a lot of shares on the stock exchange,</br>
          their search is enabled as well as the 
          choice of a category on stocks and currency.</br>
          It looks like it is shown in the picture below.

        		In addition to the views in the tables that are easy to understand, 
        		we have a graph overview.</br> At the points of the graph we can see all the 
        		mentioned stock parameters on the stock exchange.</br> We also have the ability 
        		to change the time interval on which we follow the values.</br> Once you have read the 
        		explanation of the stocks and their parameters,</br> you will easily understand the tables 
        		and the graphic representation.
